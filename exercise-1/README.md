# Exercise 1: Create a Template

The purpose of this exercise to create the HTML template that the `album-art` component will copy from.

It needs to retain the same DOM structure as each individual album cover.

The markup within the template should be identical to the existing HTML. That means all text content within the h3 and p tags should remain, along with the values in the `src` and `alt` attributes.

Give your the template an `id` of `album-art-template`.

Once this has been completed, the tests at the top of the page will pass and you can move on to exercise two.
